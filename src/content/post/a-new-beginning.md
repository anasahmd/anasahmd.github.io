For a long time, I've wanted to create a blog website, but I kept getting sidetracked for one reason or another. Often, it was because I got stuck on the technical details of the website layout. Being a perfectionist, I was never satisfied with how things turned out. This time, I decided to take a shortcut by using an Astro template to give myself a head start.

What will I be sharing here? It won't just be technical stuff—I’ll also share my thoughts and life experiences. I’m not committing to a strict schedule for posting, I’ll take my time to ensure that whatever I share is meaningful and worth reading.

I don’t have any specific goals for this blog; I’m doing it purely to satisfy my urge to write and share something with the world.
